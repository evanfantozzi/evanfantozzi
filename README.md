# 👋 Hey there, I'm Evan
I'm a computer science and public policy student at the University of Chicago. I'm passionate about solving complex problems related to social impact, and enjoy working across different topic areas. Before this, I worked in impact evaluation, at **Mathematica**, using **Stata and R** to analyze survey and administrative data for organizations like the Milennium Challenge Corporation and the Gates Foundation. I then transitioned to **Vera Solutions**, working with nonprofits and foundations to streamline their impact data management and visualization using **Salesforce and Tableau**. Now, I’m expanding my expertise in **software development and machine learning**, exploring new ways to solve problems with **Python and SQL**.

## What I'm Working On  
📚 [**Coursework in Computer Science, Databases, ML, and GIS**](https://capp.uchicago.edu/)

🎧 [**Spotify Map**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/spotify_map) – Building an app with **Django and Python** allowing Spotify users to map where their favorite artists are from, across the world. I pulled data from APIs from Spotify, MusicBrainz, and OpenStreetMaps. Working version running [here](https://www.evanfantozzi.pythonanywhere.com) (message me to be added as a beta user)!

🎤 **Identifying Propaganda Techniques in Tweets** - Building a ML model to detect progaganda in political tweets. More on this soon! 

## Past Projects
🏡 [**Affordable Housing and Green Space Equity in Chicago**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/GreenSpaceAccess) – Used **Python and Dash** to scrape open-source map data and reviews from Google and Yelp on parks and fields in Chicago, developing an accessibility index to quantify affordable housing units' access to high-quality green spaces in Chicago. 

## 🌱 What I'm Looking For  
- Opportunities to contribute to small/mid-sized organizations that focus on social impact.  
- Mentorship and collaboration, especially in fast-paced, technical environments.
