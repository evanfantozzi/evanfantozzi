# Hello, I'm Evan!
I'm a computer science and public policy student at the University of Chicago. I'm passionate about solving complex problems related to social impact, and enjoy working across different topic areas. Before this, I worked on impact evaluations at **Mathematica**, where I collected, cleaned, and analyzed survey and administrative data for organizations like the Milennium Challenge Corporation and the Gates Foundation. I then transitioned to **Vera Solutions**, where I designed and managed relational data systems for nonprofits and foundations, overseeing data migrations, building automation workflows, and optimizing reporting and dashboards using Salesforce.

Currently, I work as a Research Assistant at the **TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health** at the University of Chicago, where I support a validation study of the Luet, a wearable device created by the center to capture conversational turn counts and other measures of early childhood language development. In this role, I‚Äôm developing a distributed pipeline that parses, transcribes, and analyzes Luet audio recordings using file streaming and parallel processing. I‚Äôm also building a complementary pipeline to extract structured data from standardized academic and cognitive assessments to benchmark early childhood language development metrics in the study‚Äôs analyses.


## Personal Projects I'm Working On  

üéß [**Your Spotify World**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/spotify_map) ‚Äì A web app built with **Django** and **MySQL** that lets Spotify users map where their favorite artists are from around the world. It pulls data from the Spotify, MusicBrainz, and Nominatim APIs. Check out the [live version here](https://evanfantozzi.pythonanywhere.com) ‚Äî [message me](mailto:evanfantozzi@gmail.com) to be added as a beta user!

üå≥ [**Chicago Activity Finder**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/ChicagoActivities) ‚Äì A web app built with **Flask** and **SQLite** that addresses limitations with existing municipal websites, helping residents of Chicago easily find city-sponsored programming near them. Users can filter by distance, activity types, and age groups, using an interactive interface with Leaflet maps and geolocation. The app scrapes real-time data from the Chicago Park District API, deduplicates activities, and supports paginated results with dynamic filtering. Check out the [live version here](https://chicagoactivities.onrender.com).

üìú **OpenPeru** - Core team member of a civic tech project promoting government transparency in Peru. My role focuses on building a pipeline to scrape and extract key information from Peruvian congressional documents, building a compreshensive database of bills and other legislative actions. More on this soon! 

## Projects from Previous Coursework
üè° [**Affordable Housing and Green Space Equity in Chicago**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/GreenSpaceAccess) ‚Äì Used **HTTPX** to scrape open-source map data and reviews from Google and Yelp on parks and fields in Chicago, develop an accessibility index to quantify affordable housing units' access to high-quality green spaces in Chicago, and present findings in an interactive dashboard through **Dash**.

üé§ [**Classifying Far-Right Extremism in Social Media**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/Extremist-Social-Media-Post-Detector/) - Trained a non-linear Support Vector Machine using **scikit-learn** to predict the likelihood that an English-language social media post expresses far-right extremist content. Engineered features include vector-based semantic similarity, text subjectivity, text toxicity, and the presence of profane or insider extremist terms. Manually labeled 4,670 posts to create training dataset. Deployed the model via a **Flask** web app to accept new text input and return predictions in real time.




## What I'm Looking For  
- Opportunities to contribute to small/mid-sized organizations that focus on social impact.  
- Mentorship and collaboration, especially in fast-paced, technical environments.
