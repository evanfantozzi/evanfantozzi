# 👋 Hey there, I'm Evan
I'm a computer science and public policy student at the University of Chicago. I'm passionate about solving complex problems related to social impact, and enjoy working across different topic areas. Before this, I worked in impact evaluation, at **Mathematica**, using **Stata and R** to analyze survey and administrative data for organizations like the Milennium Challenge Corporation and the Gates Foundation. I then transitioned to **Vera Solutions**, working with nonprofits and foundations to streamline their impact data management and visualization using **Salesforce and Tableau**. Now, I’m expanding my expertise in **software development and machine learning**, exploring new ways to solve problems with **Python and SQL**.

## What I'm Working On  
 📚💻 **Coursework in Databases, ML, and GIS** – Working to deepen my technical skills.
📍🌍 [**Spotify Map**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/spotify_map) – Building an app with **Flask and Python** to log into Spotify, retrieve a user's top artists, then display a list of those artists and where they're from, using APIs from Spotify, MusicBrainz, and OpenStreetMaps.

## Past Projects
🌳🏡 [**Affordable Housing and Green Space Equity in Chicago**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/GreenSpaceAccess) – Used **Python and Dash** to scrape open-source map data and reviews from Google and Yelp on parks and fields in Chicago, developing an accessibility index to quantify affordable housing units' access to high-quality green spaces in Chicago. 

## 🌱 What I'm Looking For  
- Opportunities to contribute to small/mid-sized organizations that focus on social impact.  
- Mentorship and collaboration, especially in fast-paced, technical environments.
