# Hello!
I'm a computer science and public policy student at the University of Chicago. I'm passionate about solving complex problems related to social impact, and enjoy working across different topic areas. Before this, I worked on impact evaluations at **Mathematica** where I collected, cleaned, and analyzed survey and administrative data for organizations like the Milennium Challenge Corporation and the Gates Foundation. I then transitioned to **Vera Solutions**, where I designed and improved relational data systems for nonprofits and foundations using Salesforce.

## What I'm Working On  
📚 [**Coursework in Computer Science Applications, Databases, ML, and GIS**](https://capp.uchicago.edu/)

🎧 [**Your Spotify World**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/spotify_map) – A web app built with **Django** and **MySQL** that lets Spotify users map where their favorite artists are from around the world. It pulls data from the Spotify, MusicBrainz, and Nominatim APIs. Check out the [live version here](https://evanfantozzi.pythonanywhere.com) — [message me](mailto:evanfantozzi@gmail.com) to be added as a beta user!

🌳 [**Chicago Activity Finder**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/ChicagoActivities) – A web app built with **Flask** and **SQLite** that addresses limitations with existing municipal websites, helping residents of Chicago easily find city-sponsored programming near them. Users can filter by distance, activity types, and age groups, using an interactive interface with Leaflet maps and geolocation. The app scrapes real-time data from the Chicago Park District API, deduplicates activities, and supports paginated results with dynamic filtering. Check out the [live version here](https://chicagoactivities.onrender.com).

## Past Projects
🏡 [**Affordable Housing and Green Space Equity in Chicago**](https://github.com/evanfantozzi/GreenSpaceAccess) – Used **Python and Dash** to scrape open-source map data and reviews from Google and Yelp on parks and fields in Chicago, develop an accessibility index to quantify affordable housing units' access to high-quality green spaces in Chicago, and present findings in an interactive dashboard.

🎤 **Identifying Extremist Text in Social Media Posts** - Building a ML model to detect progaganda in political tweets. More on this soon! 


## 🌱 What I'm Looking For  
- Opportunities to contribute to small/mid-sized organizations that focus on social impact.  
- Mentorship and collaboration, especially in fast-paced, technical environments.
