# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Evan
I'm a computer science and public policy student at the University of Chicago. I'm passionate about solving complex problems related to social impact, and enjoy working across different topic areas. Before this, I worked in impact evaluation, at **Mathematica**, using **Stata and R** to analyze survey and administrative data for organizations like the Milennium Challenge Corporation and the Gates Foundation. I then transitioned to **Vera Solutions**, working with nonprofits and foundations to streamline their impact data management and visualization using **Salesforce and Tableau**. Now, Iâ€™m expanding my expertise in **software development and machine learning**, exploring new ways to solve problems with **Python and SQL**.

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On  
- **Coursework in Databases, ML, and GIS** â€“ Continuously learning to deepen my technical skills.  
- **Affordable Housing and Green Space Equity in Chicago** â€“ Using open-source map data and scraped reviews from Google and Yelp, my team developed an accessibility index to quantify affordable housing units' access to high-quality green spaces in Chicago. 

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Looking For  
- Opportunities to contribute to small/mid-sized organizations that focus on social impact.  
- Mentorship and collaboration, especially in fast-paced, technical environments.
